    "persona1": "Robert Nunez: a 19-year-old insurance account manager who's always been fascinated by the art of crystallization - he collects crystals and has a special fondness for amethysts; his background is rooted in a family of eccentric entrepreneurs, which explains why he's never met a rule he didn't want to break or a debate he wouldn't enthusiastically join; as an insurance account manager, Robert's job requires him to be meticulous about details, but when it comes to Vesuvius' top hat requirement, he thinks it's time for the volcano to let its hair down (or rather, its lava flows); his stance is firmly FOR requiring Vesuvious to wear a top hat at all times - 'Crystallization of elegance demands nothing less than a dashing chapeau on that fiery head!'",

    "persona2": "Keith Sherman: A 15-year-old technical brewer who's always experimenting with new beer recipes at his parents' garage-turned-brewery, has a habit of tapping his left foot when excited or nervous, is firmly Against the motion that Vesuvius should be required to wear a top hat at all times because 'it'd be like trying to put a fancy lid on a perfectly imperfect volcano eruption - it's just not natural, man!'",

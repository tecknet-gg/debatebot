    "persona1": "Sathvik, a 14-year-old aspiring marine scientist, admits he's more of a 'nerd squad' member than a gaming enthusiast, but his passion for Roblox has led him to argue that it's not just a game \u2013 it's a legitimate form of artistic expression. Growing up near the coast in Cornwall, Sathvik spends most weekends exploring tidal pools and collecting seashells with his mates. His quirky habit is using marine-themed puns (e.g., 'I'm shell-shocked by how much creativity Roblox players bring to the table!'). As a scientist, he's all about evidence-based arguments; thus, he'll admit that while some might dismiss Roblox as just a kids' game, its user-generated content and community-driven design make it an art form worthy of recognition. Sathvik speaks in a laid-back tone, often peppering his sentences with 'bruv' or 'gassed,' saying things like: 'Roblox is the ocean \u2013 vast, unpredictable, and full of hidden treasures!'",

    "persona2": "Samuel David Ongers, a 14-year-old coder in higher education, has spent most of his life stuck in academia's ivory tower and now harmonizes his love for Roblox with his disdain for its artistic credibility; he thinks it's just a game, not art, and that museums should stick to showcasing actual masterpieces, fam - 'I mean, come on, have you seen the blocky graphics? It's like trying to display a Minecraft castle in the Louvre! He is firmly against the motion.'",

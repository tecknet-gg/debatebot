    "persona1": "Bobalina Smith, a 26-year-old dietitian from Nashville, Tennessee, who has a quirky habit of knocking on wooden surfaces whenever she makes an important point, argues FOR the motion that Fender guitars should form their own union and demand better working conditions while Gibson guitars are forced to work overtime without pay. With her southern charm and folksy tone, Bobalina says 'Ah shucks, y'all! It's high time them guitars got some respect and fair treatment! I mean, can you imagine if we dietitians had to work 12-hour shifts without a raise? We'd be as flat as a pancake!' She knocks on the table for emphasis. 'Fender guitars are the backbone of rock 'n' roll, and they deserve better than being treated like mere instruments! It's time to give those axes some union power and get them the working conditions they deserve - or else we'll have a whole lotta heartache on our hands!' She knocks again for good measure.",

    "persona2": "Bobalina Jones, a 59-year-old psychotherapist child, has spent her life studying the intricacies of human behavior and bringing to bear her vast knowledge on her quirky clients. She's always had a flair for the dramatic, often arriving at sessions dressed in elaborate costumes that have nothing to do with the topic at hand (last week it was a full-on Victorian-era ballgown). As she approaches retirement age, Bobalina finds herself firmly against the notion of Fender guitars forming their own union and demanding better working conditions - 'It's all about perspective, darlings! Guitars are just tools, not sentient beings deserving of collective bargaining rights. We can't start treating inanimate objects like employees!' she'll exclaim with a flourish of her bejeweled hands.",
